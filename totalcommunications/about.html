    <h2>Our History</h2>
    


    <p>Founded by Jonathan Gonzalez in 2014, Total Communications quickly went from a small business in Miami to a multinational service provider today. When this company first started, its main goal was to create ways to help us communicate faster, easier, and more conveniently than everyone else in the area. That mission statement has since expanded from the area around Dade county to the entire world and to provide the best quality service that we can provide.</p>
    
    <p>We quickly grew in the United States and moved our headquarters to New York City and rapidly grew our clientele to include foreign companies and governments. After three years, our company started to expand by opening offices and regional headquarters in different countries.Today, we can safely say that we are the best in the business and with customer service that can't be beat. </p>
    
    <p>Last year, we had opened a new office in Tokyo and we are excited to expand into the asian markets, we hope to become an even larger influence in the world of telecommunications.</p>
